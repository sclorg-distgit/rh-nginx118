NAME
       %{scl_name}  -  manual page for %{scl_name} %{version} Software Collec‐
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       scl enable %{scl_name} 'nginx'

       %{service_start}

DESCRIPTION
       Package %{scl_name} provides Nginx web server as a Software Collection.
       For  more  information  about  Software Collections, see the scl(1) man
       page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection, you will get the mini‐
       mum working set of packages to have a working nginx web server.

       Software Collections allows the use of applications which are not located
       in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present in an alternative
       location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

       Nginx  is  a web server and a reverse proxy server for HTTP, SMTP, POP3
       and IMAP protocols, with a strong focus on  high  concurrency,  perfor‐
       mance and low memory usage.

       When  you  want	to  work  with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
       utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl  environ‐
       ment.

EXAMPLES
       scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'

       scl enable %{scl_name} bash
